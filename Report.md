# Sort Analysis Data

## Results Table
Make sure to go out to at least 100,000 (more are welcome), and you have 10 different values (more welcome). You are welcome to go farther, but given 100,000 can take about 20 seconds using a selection sort on a fast desktop computer, and 200,000 took 77 seconds, you start having to wait much longer the more 0s you add. However, to build a clearer line, you will want more data points, and you will find merge and quick are able to handle higher numbers easier (but at a cost you will explore below). 

You are free to write a script to run the program and build your table (then copy that table built into the markdown). If you do that, please include the script into the repo.  Note: merge sort is going to be completed in the workshop for Module 06. You can start on it now, but welcome to wait.

## BigO Analysis  / Questions

### 1. Build a line chart
Build a line chart using your favorite program. Your X axis will be N increasing, and your Y access will be the numbers for each type of sort. This will create something similar to the graph in the instructions, though it won't be as smooth.

Include the image in your markdown. As a reminder, you save the image in your repo, and use [image markdown].



### 2. Convinced?
Given the direction of the line chart, are you "convinced" of the complexity of each of the sorts? Why or why not?


### 3. Big O
Build another table that presents the best, worst, and average case for Bubble, Selection, Insertion, Merge, and Quick. You are free to use resources for this, but please reference them if you do. 


#### 3.2 Worst Case
Provide example of arrays that generate _worst_ case for Bubble, Selection, Insertion, Merge Sorts


#### 3.3 Best Case
Provide example of arrays that generate _best_ case for Bubble, Selection, Insertion, Merge Sorts 


#### 3.4 Memory Considerations
Order the various sorts based on which take up the most memory when sorting to the least memory. You may have to research this, and include the mathematical notation. 

### 4. Growth of Functions
Give the following values, place them correctly into *six* categories. Use the bullets, and feel free to cut and paste the full LatexMath we used to generate them.  

$n^2$  
$n!$  
$n\log_2n$  
$5n^2+5n$  
$10000$  
$3n$    
$100$  
$2^n$  
$100n$  
$2^{(n-1)}$

### 5. Growth of Function Language

Pair the following terms with the correct function in the table. 
* Constant, Logarithmic, Linear, Quadratic, Cubic, Exponential, Factorial

| Big $O$     |  Name  |
| ------      | ------ |
| $O(n^3)$    |  your answer here |
| $O(1)$      |   |
| $O(n)$      |   |
| $O(\log_2n)$ |   |
| $O(n^2)$    |   |
| $O(n!)$     |   |
| $O(2^n)$    |   |



### 6. Stable vs Unstable
Look up stability as it refers to sorting. In your own words, describe one sort that is stable and one sort that isn't stable  


### 6.2 When stability is needed?
Explain in your own words a case in which you will want a stable algorithm over an unstable. Include an example. 

### 7. Gold Thief

You are planning a heist to steal a rare coin that weighs 1.0001 ounces. The problem is that the rare coin was mixed with a bunch of counter fit coins. You know the counter fit coins only weight 1.0000 ounce each. There are in total 250 coins.  You have a simple balance scale where the coins can be weighed against each other. Hint: don't think about all the coins at once, but how you can break it up into even(ish) piles. 

#### 7.1 Algorithm
Describe an algorithm that will help you find the coin. We encourage you to use pseudo-code, but not required.

#### 7.2 Time Complexity
What is the average time complexity of your algorithm?
